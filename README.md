# Simple HTTP Server
SimpleHTTPServer: A quick way to serve up a directory.

Python’s SimpleHTTPServer is the classic quick solution for serving the files in a directory via HTTP (often, you’ll access them locally, via localhost). This is useful, because there are some things that don’t work with file: URLs in web browsers.

Save `simser.sh` to desired directory.

Modify `simser.sh` argument's mode with `chmod a+x`

Usage: `./simser.sh`

A directory via HTTP often, you’ll access them locally, via localhost, will be creeated.
