# Simple HTTP Server
SimpleHTTPServer: A quick way to serve up a directory.

Python’s SimpleHTTPServer is the classic quick solution for serving the files in a directory via HTTP (often, you’ll access them locally, via localhost). This is useful, because there are some things that don’t work with file: URLs in web browsers.

Usage: `./simser.sh`
